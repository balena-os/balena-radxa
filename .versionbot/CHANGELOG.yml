    - subject: Remove extlinux.conf from blacklist
      hash: b5eadcfb3a296eea2554dc0cbdd16002d51c5169
      body: |
        We recently updated the BSP which in turn changed the dtb name.
        We reflected the device tree name change in extlinux.conf but because
        extlinux.conf is blacklisted then after a host OS update the new
        extlinux.conf does not get copied over so the newer dtb does not
        get loaded.

                Otherwise patch updates of ESR branches move the ESR phase when
                they

                should not. For example, if 2022.1.1 is current, 2022.1.2 is also

                current and should not move 2022.1.1 to sunset.

                When tests execute quicker, a race condition can occur where
                config.json

                is edited to remove the dnsServers property, but /run/dnsmasq.servers is

                not changed yet. This causes the test to fail, as the file is not empty.

                    not ok 1 - We should have an empty /run/dnsmasq.servers file.
                      ---

                Fix this by waiting until the InvocationID of dnsmasq.service changes.

                        The root cause of this issue was an integer overflow in
                        32-bit platforms

                        -- specifically, when explicitly converting `io.Reader` offsets

                        (`int64`) to slice indices (`int`, which is only 32-bit long on 32-bit

                        platforms).


                        We already had in place the checks supposed to ensure slice bounds where

                        always within the expected bounds. So, in a way, this commit just

                        re-organizes the code so that we perform safely this required `int64` to

                        `int` type conversion.

                the packages end up empty as we have compression enabled.

                        This commit updates all backends that write to /mnt/boot
                        to do it

                        through a new `lib/host-utils` module. Writes are now done using write +

                        sync as rename is not an atomic operation in vfat.


                        The change also applies for writes through the `/v1/host-config`

                        endpoint.


                        Finally this change includes some improvements on tests.

                        The status field does not indicate the current state of
                        the Engine on the device.

                        Rather, it only indicates whether the HTTP response returned successfully or not.


                        To get the current state of the device, i.e. whether it has applied target state or not,

                        use the `appState` field in the response.

                        The linked issue describes the Supervisor not cleaning
                        up locks it creates due

                        to crashing at just the wrong time. After internal discussion we decided to

                        differentiate Supervisor-created lockfiles from user-created lockfiles by using

                        the `nobody` UID (65534) for Supervisor-created lockfiles.


                        As the existing NPM lockfile lib does not allow creating lockfiles atomically

                        with different UIDs, we move to using the lockfile binary, which is part of the

                        procmail package. To allow nonroot users to write to lock directories, permissions

                        are changed to allow write access by nonroot users.

                        Migration `M00008` had a bug with the check for legacy
                        apps, which

                        resulted in devices that had at some point been updated from a single

                        container supervisor to get the error


                        ```

                        Undefined binding(s) detected when compiling UPDATE. Undefined column(s): [appUuid] query

                        ```


                        This adds a new migration with the fix to ensure broken fix the

                        inconsistent database state.

                        This change updates types and database format in order
                        to allow

                        receiving the new format of the target state from the cloud and allow

                        applications to keep working.


                        This change also updates metadata in the containers, meaning services

                        will need to be restarted on supervisor update

                        It seems that in some cases the supervisor can report

                        an image without a `status` field leading to a cloud side 401 response.

                        See #1905 for more details.

                Git 2.35.2 was released to fix a security issue with multi-user
                machines. Add `device_dir` to the whitelist to avoid this error.

                Also, let's make sure an error is thrown when the hostapp cannot
                be made public.

              hash: c4ce541526455c8cb891e7c76889e0d4cb2735b1
              body: >
                There are known situations in which balenaEngine times out
                during

                initialization (for example, during aufs to overlayfs migrations, or

                when restarting a device that was running a large number of containers).

                When these time outs occur, Systemd kills the Engine, causing further

                problems.


                To avoid these cases, this commit disables timeouts during the Engine

                initialization.


                This is also aligned with the default Systemd settings distributed with

                the Moby project.

                * Fixes #2569

                * ensure OpenVPN client always starts with the latest CA certificate
                  from API config endpoint as this certificate may have changed and
                  we don't want VPN to be down for ~24 hours until os-config is triggered

                      hash: 59f6cd6dc32ee178532dbf7595933ef606cebf39

                        This adds two new integration tests:


                        * TestDeltaSize: this is meant to catch regressions on delta sizes. It
                          generates deltas and compare their sizes with the delta sizes we get
                          as of now. If the size increases, the test fails.
                        * TestDeltaCorrectness: checks if applying a delta indeed results in the
                          same image as we had originally.

                        A number of different test cases (different images with distinct

                        features) are tested for each of these integration tests.

                Let's ensure tools like fixdep are built in container
                and not reused from the yocto build, otherwise they
                may not run if they were linked against a different
                version of libc that may not be available in the kernel
                modules build container.

                This fixes the following error encountered when doing
                a Poky Honister build for the balena-intel repository:

                  scripts/basic/fixdep: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34'

                This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel
                patch backported

                from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when secure boot

                is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the kernel patch

                and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file that enables

                lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


                That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it and it adds

                extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no point keeping

                it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel to know

                whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back and rebase.

                In most cases there is not enough space on rootfs to extract

                and load a local hostapp image when the balena-host tmpdir

                is on the same partition.


                This uses a data mount to ensure temporary extracted files of the

                compressed image will not fill the target sysroot.

        We revert the commit that converted the decimal number stored in the
        bootcount environment variable to hex because when the environment
        is updated then the bootcount comparison fails during the next boot
        because it cannot compare numbers that use different bases.

                Should this happen, we use sgdisk to check and recover the end gpt

                This caters for the use case of custom device types that are not

                balena-cloud's registry by querying the `supervisor_version` endpoint,

                for example when using openBalena.

                Providing the image name in the command line provides an update path

                https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/1eee36a5520b5a89fb4d0d6af6f9cb0217a3164f

                was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,

                building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing

                headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible

                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the

                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the

                failed check in the above mentioned patch.


                Since we are not using the functions provided

                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this

                config.

                In the current state the by-state symlink for balena-efi
                partition

                is not generated for two reasons:

                - 60-resin-update-state.rules only react to resin-* partition names

                - the root device is not identified correctly in resin_update_state_probe
                  for LUKS devices

                This patch fixes both the issues and makes use of the by-state symlink

                instead of by-label.

                This patch adds the check for PCRs

                - 0 - firmware/UEFI blob

                - 1 - firmware/UEFI config

                - 2 - Expansion card firmware blobs

                - 3 - Expansion card firmware configs


                The full protection is only applied on first boot after provisioning,

                flasher only locks against PCRs 0, 2 and 3.

                This is because when using flasher, the environment is not in the same

                state as the one we want to lock to. In particular the boot order is

                different (flasher is booted from a different drive than the resulting OS).

                As for now we were not able to find a better solution than fully locking

                only on first boot. This means the device must be booted in a secure

                environment at least once after provisioning.

                        The moby engine v20.x.y adds some selinux [security
                        configurations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration)

                        depending on the [container configuration](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/daemon/create.go#L214).

                        This would cause the supervisor to enter a service restart loop as the

                        current and target service configurations will never match. The

                        supervisor now ignores selinux specific security options since those are

                        not supported by balenaOS.

                        storagemigration package, which should make future maintenance easier

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads
                        after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        start. If we find both an aufs AND an overlay2 storage root, we cleanup

                        the aufs data.

                        Similarly when processing the destination layers to generate deltas we

                        vulnerable to the same issues.

                        If the engine process is terminated during the layer
                        extraction transaction,

                        before Commit or Cancel is called on the transaction, a new FS layer can be created

                        by the graph driver without any link to the layers metadata.


                        This change ensures we don't perform any actions on the graph driver storage until

                        the FS layer ID (the cacheID) is  persisted as a part of the transaction data.


                        We can use this data to clean up the graph driver storage on next process start

                        deleting all data associated with the transactions terminated abruptly.

                the

                VPN keys when provisioning is finished and the `apiKey` is removed.


                Note that flasher images make changes to `/mnt/boottmp/config.json` so

                we still need to manually kick `prepare-openvpn` in

                `resin-device-register`, which is preferable to modifying services to

                watch multiple paths.

                Upstream kernel added a new fkms overlay for
                the Pi4 and CM4 and switched to using it
                from overlay-map, however, we were not aware
                of this.

                Let's add a vcdbg testcase to warn in case the RPi
                firmware fails to load any overlay or dtb, and set
                gpu_mem to 64 so that vcdbg can run.

              hash: 13cf7c9fef0a6e0df6b042ba34ceaa7a0d005254

                We want the VPN to start unconditionally even if the
                connectivity URL

                is not reachable.


                The rationale for adding the dependency in the first place was that

                without an initial timesync certificate checks may fail. This can still

                happen, but the VPN will retry continuously and eventually succeed once

                the time is synched.


                What happens now is that the VPN is delayed until the http sync, so if

                the connectivity URL is blocked or unreachable, but the internet is

                accessible, VPN will not even launch and no remote debugging is possible.


                Fixes #2508

                the introduction of a better, more fine grained mechanism.

                In order to avoid the need to unlock encrypted partitions in
                GRUB we want

                to use a custom stage2 bootloader. Since that is not ready yet, emulate that

                by copying flasher kernel to the EFI partition, start it from GRUB, have it

                unlock all the partitions, find the real kernel and kexec into it.

                If resin-init-flasher.conf has LUKS=1 flasher will:

                - Add extra 2MB to each partition for the LUKS header

                - Split resin-boot into EFI and linux boot

                - LUKS-format the partitions, copy image contents after unlocking

                - Propagate signatures for secure boot

                We add this this check since we discovered
                that with newer boot firmware the Pi4 will
                not reboot when under-voltage is reported.

                We don't mark the test as failed in
                this case, since there may be devices that
                continue to work even if under-powered and we
                don't want to block or delay development if the
                DUT is remote and cannot be checked or replaced
                easily.

                This check provides an indication for further
                debugging of failed test cases.

                When resizing the filesystem fails, such as when resize2fs won't
                touch

                it because it's dirty, the partition gets resized, but not the

                filesystem. The script will not attempt to resize the filesystem again,

                as it detects the partition has already been resized.


                Split these actions apart, so that the filesystem resize is always

                attempted. If resize2fs detects that the filesystem is already filling

                available space, it will exit with no action taken.

                Let's only apply this code to pre-warrior as intended. Starting
                with warrior this code is in poky so we can rely on it from
                there instead of keeping a duplicate in meta-balena-common.
                This helps with BSPs that may define their own tasks (configure,
                compile and so on) for u-boot (keeping this fragments merging
                code in meta-balena-common would have the effect of overwriting
                these tasks from here and thus breaking the build).

                jq is used in the bootfiles hostapp-update
                hook for accessing config.json, which may have
                one of the modification dates invalid,
                as we've seen during testing. We thus need to
                avoid performing a touch on config.json
                to avoid reloading of containers.

              body: >
                The chrony driftfile is not being updated at shutdown due to an

                incorrect mount service dependency in the systemd chronyd.service

                file. The current dependency on 'var-volatile-lib' does not cover the

                subsequent bind mounting of the '/var/lib/chrony' sub-directory, so

                the chrony directory gets unmounted at shutdown before the drift file

                has been updated.


                This issue is solved by changing the mount service dependency from

                'var-volatile-lib' to 'bind-var-lib-chrony' (which is similar to the

                way bind mount dependencies are already handled for the NetworkManager

                and bluetooth services).

                Poky releases older than Honister should stick to rust v1.36
                which has been used in balenaOS builds so far.

                Newer ones should prefer v1.54, which is the latest rust
                version to use the Honister syntax.

                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not

                there.


                Commit bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2 switches to use /tmp

                to store the new UUID for the root partition on first boot after

                generating new UUIDs as this is backwards compatible.


                However, this means that the udev database in the initramfs is recreated

                on the final system instead of reused. This becomes a problems for DM

                devices (used in luks based disk encryption), as they are not re-processed

                by udevd.


                This change will use /run if available, so new releases that may implement

                disk encryption work, or /tmp if not so it still remains backwards

                compatible for HUP from older releases.

                Some BSPs name the u-boot such as u-boot-imx_2020 for example.
                Because of that, our existing bbappend called u-boot_%.bbappend
                will not match it and will fail to be applied.
                This PR is a first pass at solving this by moving at least the
                SRC_URI appending part from this bbappend and into the
                resin-u-boot.bbclass instead. Further investigation is needed
                to see if we can remove this bbappend altogether since we may
                have all boards using Poky Warrior or newer, making this
                u-boot bbappend obsolete.

                The CM4 IO-Board was the first device
                which exhibited an issue in which
                the MAC address was set to an
                unprogrammed value AA:AA:AA...:AA.

                We've addressed this in the device repo,
                meanwhile it has been fixed in upstream
                too, so let's check and catch this should
                it happen again.

                the /device-types/v1 endpoint is deprecated and we can remove
                the logo from the device repos so we can also stop handling it
                from here. Instead, the logo will be used from the hw contracts.

                For example, when we branch an ESR release, the meta-balena branch is

                will be a proper semver.

                the signature just gets ignored for non secure boot setups. The .signed

                symlink was in place for backwards compatibility but nothing is using it

                anymore therefore we can safely remove it.

                This patch replaces the kernel being shipped with the one that
                we eventually

                sign for EFI - without signing the original file used would be identical

                but after applying signature, the signed version is the one we want to ship.


                It also fixes the file name for the detached signature, which must match

                the name of the associated file.

              hash: 2bb18707557979ed6466f45602de4ecf5b386c57
              body: >
                Add a new timesync-https systemd service to synchronise the
                system

                time at boot using an HTTPS header. The service uses curl to request

                an HTTPS header from either $API_ENDPOINT/connectivity-check (default)

                or the URL defined by the os.network.connectivity.uri field in

                config.json. The URL used *must* return HTTP code 204 (No Content)

                in response to a request so that we can determine that we have full

                network connectivity and are not operating behind a captive portal.


                The date field returned by a valid header is used to set the current

                system time. The date/time derived from the header is assumed to be a

                reasonable source of 'truth' such that it can be used to adjust the

                system time both backwards and forwards. This will compensate for any

                erroneous timestamps saved via fake-hwclock or any invalid data

                read from an RTC.


                The service will exit when a valid response has been received. Poll

                attempts will be made at an increasing interval starting at 2s and

                doubling up to a maximum of 64s. Polling will continue at the maximum

                interval until a valid response has been received.


                This service will provide initial time synchronisation for devices

                where NTP ports have been blocked. For devices where NTP access is

                available it should ensure that any system 'time jump' is only a few

                seconds when NTP synchronisation is eventually achieved. It also

                allows other services to start with a reasonably accurate time

                without having to wait for the NTP synchronisation process to

                complete.


                Services that are ordered after the new time-sync-https-wait target

                can be sure that full network connectivity has been achieved and that

                time has been synchronised with an accuracy of a few seconds.

                The interface test uses a simple ping to ensure a specific
                interface

                works. It sends ten packets, and expects ten packets back. However, the

                default interval is one second, which increases the time taken for the

                test while not adding anything of value.


                Reduce the timeout to the minimum non-privileged interval of 2ms.

                The hook tries to read EFI variables from efivarfs but this is
                not always

                mounted within the container. We have already validated that we are running

                in EFI mode therefore we can just check whether it is already mounted

                and eventually mount with no further checks.


                This also adds graceful handling of nonexistent variables since not all

                UEFI implementations come with secure boot support.

                At this moment GRUB drops to rescue shell if config is invalid

                or if signatures are missing/wrong. This lets the user disable the signature

                checks altogether.


                With this patch GRUB outputs nothing and accepts no user input if signing

                is configured.

                approach and we will look for a clean solution.

                GRUB can not use the TPM easily to unlock the volumes and find
                the kernel

                on an encrypted partition. Instead, we choose to store a linux kernel

                and use it as 2nd stage bootloader to unlock the partition, load the actual

                kernel and kexec into it. This should eventually be replaced by a proper

                2nd stage bootloader that is being worked on.

                Currently the two classes would keep the original files
                untouched and store

                the signed versions as .signed. This patch reverses the logic - the signed

                files replace the original ones and the unsigned version is stored as .unsigned.

                This is because there is no real use-case for the unsigned files, we always

                want to ship the signed version, even if the particular DT does not require it,

                this causes no harm.

                Previously, the core service exposed a /proxy endpoint that
                would start

                up a proxy remotely, which would be used by a test in the connectivity

                module. However, the endpoint returned the address for the testbot to be

                used as the proxy in the response, and this required manual

                configuration of the interface. Additionally, it requires the worker

                service to install and provide glider for forward proxying.


                Move the proxy (glider) to a container on the device being tested,

                which simplifies configuration, and reduces the complexity and size of

                the interface of Leviathan.

                The behaviour for non-LUKS system should be the same as before,
                an extra step is performed when LUKS resize is necessary.

                Add a test to wait for the chronyd service to become active
                before

                starting the time sync tests.


                The current chronyd tests assume that the chronyd service is

                instantly available at boot time. With the addition of the new

                HTTPS time synchronisation service the starting of chronyd can be

                delayed by a few seconds so we need to ensure that the service

                is actually running before proceeding.

                        previously switch would treat S_IFIFO and S_IFSOCK as
                        the same, passing

                        both of the to mkfifo, which lead to EINVAL errors when trying to create

                        the socket, we instead handle socket separately.


                        Also adds cases for this to the unit and integration tests of the

                        migrator.

                The boot partition needs to be generated before creating the
                balenaos-img

                but is not part of the root filesystem generation.


                The decoupling allows to build just the docker rootfs image without

                having to build the balenaos-img target.

                Let's increase the current value for the rollback-altboot
                bootcount to 3, to account for accidental poweroffs triggered
                by users or by power supplys when booting into the new OS,
                during HUP.

                When the limit is reached, u-boot will proceed to try
                to boot into the old OS.

                The Rock Pi 4B uses a file named hw_intf.conf for
                enabling/disabling interfaces and for loading overlays.
                Just noting that the syntax is also slightly different
                from the config.txt file on RaspberryPi.

                Let's blacklist this file to avoid overriding
                it during an OS update.

                When user namespacing was enabled in the kernel by default, a
                separate

                commit [0] was introduced to disable the feature at runtime, to allow

                users/administrators to explicitly choose to enable it, avoiding

                potential security implications.


                However, some applications such as Chromium's sandbox, require either

                SUID or user namespacing to work. Disabling this feature on boards

                that previously enabled it necessitates container modifications and

                potentially breaks previously working applications.


                Create a distro feature to disable user namespacing by default in

                meta-balena, while allowing device types to keep it enabled to maintain

                compatibility with their original behavior.

      body: |
        There are cases when the rootfs is read-only. In such cases,
        the approach of updating the systemd service responsible for
        loading the bluetooth firmware will not work.

        Instead we rework it and use an udev rule and systemd service
        combination to load the bluetooth firmware.

        Also, we change the logic of getting the /dev node because
        the current device tree does not define a node named "bt_uart"
        and instead we grep for "wireless-bluetooth".

                At runtime we can now enable development features that were
                previously

                configured using the development-image feature. That feature also

                configured U-Boot for OS development.


                Now we have two distinct functionalities:


                * A runtime development configuration variable that configures the

                device to facilitate application development

                * A build time osdev-image feature that configures the OS for BSP and OS

                development


                This allows us to merge the current production/development images into

                a single image.

                the new OS anymore. This is necessary only when updating from older

                OS versions in which the supervisor adds the isolcpus

                setting to the boot partition extlinux.conf file.

                Replace Dockerfile image %%BALENA_MACHINE_NAME%% var with

                %%BALENA_ARCH%% for better compatibility


                Device types lacking matching tags in the balenalib Docker Hub account

                will fail tests when a matching image is not found. Switch to

                BALENA_ARCH instead, to maintain compatibility.

                        In these cases we want to avoid restarting the same services

                        manually from the supervisor.

                      body: >
                        PR #1749 introduced a bug when pushing local target
                        state. An update to

                        the [image name normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)

                        failed to consider the local image name format. This results in mangling

                        of image names in the database, i.e. the image `ubuntu:latest` is stored

                        as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by the

                        dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.


                        This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the supervisor

                        journal logs as


                        ```

                        getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
                            at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
                        ```


                        Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the mangled image

                        name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to remove the

                        supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting the

                        database should be side effect free.

                        dependent ids optional and rely on using general UUIDs and user known identifiers

                        for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction by removing some of those

                        comparisons for v2 target state.


                        - imageId to be replaced with imageName

                        - serviceId to be replace by serviceName

                        - releaseId to be replaced by commit (future release_uuid)


                        This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it doesn't completely get rid of

                        these identifiers (which are still being used by supervisor API and for state

                        patch), but will not depend on those identifiers for calculating steps to target state.

                        The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker
                        IDs as the main

                        way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if the target

                        state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the supervisor will always use

                        the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to tag the image on

                        the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to ensure

                        consistency is maintained between the database and the engine.


                        Using tags allows to simplify query and removal operations, since now

                        removing the image now means removing tags matching the image name.


                        Before this change the supervisor relied only on information in the

                        supervisor database, and used that to remove images by docker ID. However, the docker

                        id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the same id between

                        releases or between services in the same release.

                        The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex
                        instance from the

                        db module but that was leading to issues when running tests using `test:fast`.

                        This provides a fix for the test module that just removes the destroy

                        call entirely (it turns out it is not necessary).

                Since kernel v5.10 this file is generated when using
                modules_prepare. As

                the kernel-modules-headers contains pre-built target binaries, we also

                need to include this file in the package.


                This is not a problem when using kernel-source as a modules_prepare is

                always required.

              hash: 9b032f2fddc970db13147b4e637abd1bada1f234

                The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto
                cache, which

                made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


                This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache to ensure

                this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have its own copy.

                Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when
                two

                builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants during deploy)

                because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the same moment.

                Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should fix the issue.

                Some kernel configuration are only applicable from specific
                kernel

                versions. This commit adds a function that allows to add a specific

                configuration set only from a given kernel version.

                This allows to re-use this functionality. Note that the
                `KERNEL_VERSION`

                variable is only available after the kernel has been built as it relies

                on get_kernelversion_headers() poky function and utsrelease.h being

                generated. This function parses the Makefile so only needs the source.

                Change the NetworkManager NTP dispatcher script to update the

                on/offline status of the NTP sources on 'connectivity-change' events

                instead of 'up/down' events.


                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                network interface. It makes more sense to run it for

                'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

              hash: 31c3ae8ad5c7ad45e450349b6972524da120e96c
              body: >
                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing
                enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as RHEL, in

                the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have chosen.
