      body: >
        Recent meta-balena releases that combine the OS variants into a single

        image require to remove the `zap_empty_root_password` postprocess
        command

        (see meta-balena@6444043c250589cac693de8b259646d79961bbd0), which leaves

        a double comma that is not supported by older bitbakes (before Dunfell).


        This commit uses a forked Poky that allows this double comma statement
        as

        a temporary solution until the device is updated to Dunfell.

                Some kernel configuration are only applicable from specific
                kernel

                versions. This commit adds a function that allows to add a
                specific

                configuration set only from a given kernel version.

                This allows to re-use this functionality. Note that the
                `KERNEL_VERSION`

                variable is only available after the kernel has been built as it
                relies

                on get_kernelversion_headers() poky function and utsrelease.h
                being

                generated. This function parses the Makefile so only needs the
                source.

                Change the NetworkManager NTP dispatcher script to update the

                on/offline status of the NTP sources on 'connectivity-change'
                events

                instead of 'up/down' events.


                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                network interface. It makes more sense to run it for

                'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in
                whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

              hash: 31c3ae8ad5c7ad45e450349b6972524da120e96c
              body: >
                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing
                enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and
                Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in
                the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more
                conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the
                kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of
                application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally
                unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max
                number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but
                without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as
                RHEL, in

                the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have
                chosen.

                introduced when images including
                8227a61f6bef6d93cc6a5acd0ef93a2012079964

                made it to production.

                We can now use a runtime drop-in unit placed under /run/systemd/
                to

                configure the balena-host service, which doesn't require us to
                remount

                the rootfs.
